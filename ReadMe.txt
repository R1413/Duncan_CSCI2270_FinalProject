[COOL GAME TITLE]

Project Summary

This program is a spin off of the traditional Chess; however, rather than taking place on a simple 8x8 board it takes place on an 8x8x8 board, IT'S IN THREE DIMENSIONS. Many of the game pieces are slightly altered so that they can move along the new dimension. There are also two additional pieces (yet to be named) that are able to move in slightly more complicated ways than the altered pieces. Have fun!
